# gcc
 - `gcc -E a.c` preprocessing, the output is printed to the console
 - `gcc -E -o a.i a.c`, the output is saved in the file `a.i`
 - `gcc -S a.c`, compiling, the output is saved in the file `a.s`
 - `gcc -S -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables a.c`, to remove instructions like `cfi_startproc`.
 - `gcc -c a.c`, assembling, the output is `a.o`
 - `gcc -v -c a.c` (or combined with other options like `-E`,`-S`), show verbose information, such as searching directories for header files and libraries

## gcc options
 - `-Wall` turn on all warnings
 - `-Wextra` turn on some options that are not turned on by `-Wall`
 - `-Werror`, consider warnings as errors
 - `-std=c11`, turn on C++11

# objdump

 - `-D`, disassemble all sections, such as `.text`, `.data`, `.comment`, `.eh_frame`
 - `-M intel` to display as intel syntax, insteal of the default `AT&T` syntax
