# gcc
 - `gcc -E a.c` preprocessing, the output is printed to the console
 - `gcc -E -o a.i a.c`, the output is saved in the file `a.i`
 - `gcc -S a.c`, compiling, the output is saved in the file `a.s`
 - `gcc -S -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables a.c`, to remove instructions like `cfi_startproc`.
 - `gcc -c a.c`, assembling, the output is `a.o`
 - `gcc -v -c a.c` (or combined with other options like `-E`,`-S`), show verbose information, such as searching directories for header files and libraries

## gcc options
 - `-Wall` turn on all warnings
 - `-Wextra` turn on some options that are not turned on by `-Wall`
 - `-Werror`, consider warnings as errors
 - `-std=c11`, turn on C++11
 - 
 
## nm
 - `nm a.o` to view symbols inside the object file `a.o` (or use `readelf -s a.o` to view the symbot table)
 - `nm -C a.o` to view demangled symblos (or use `nm a.o | c++filt`)
 - `nm -A a.o` or `nm -o a.o` to show the filename `a.o` at the front of each line. `-A` and `-o` are equivalent.

### Use cases
1. There are several object files: a.o, b.o, c.o and there are compiled with `-g` option. Find out which object file contains the 
symblo `func`
 - `nm -A -l *.o`  (note -l is the letter l, short for -line-numbers)

2. List only the symbols with external linkage (i.e., global variables, global functions, undefined variables and functions)
 - `nm -g a.o`

3. List only undefined symbols 
 - `nm -u a.o`

4. There are some struct variables in the object file `a.o`, list their sizes:
 - `nm -S a.o`

# objdump
 - `-d`, disassemble sections containing instructions
 - `-D`, disassemble all sections, such as `.text`, `.data`, `.comment`, `.eh_frame`
 - `-M intel` to display as intel syntax, insteal of the default `AT&T` syntax
